 Were looking to create an algo trading bot that provides indicators, such as support/resistance levels, RSI, bolinger bands, squeeze, simple moving averages, average directional index (ADX) to make predictions of where the stock price is going to go. From there we will look to add buy and sell signals that will give us the greatest profitability as the stock is moving between support and resistance levels.

ML: Rainbow ,Prophet model
